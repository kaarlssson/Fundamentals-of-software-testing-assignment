# TODO

> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?

- This exprience was interestin. When i signed for this course i did even realize how many small things you have to take into consideration when testing diffrent things. Having specific things to test made this much easier to understand and use.

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.

- First i read the instructions and after that i went through the pages in gitlab.

I went through the files one by one. First i filled the documentation and tags. Second i set the variables.
Test cases i started from positive and then went to ingocnito to do the negative tests.
I tried to write everything in the most simple form i could.

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management.

- There are many extensions that are great tools. But since i have not used them i am not too familiar with them. A friend who does some testing recommended jira.

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?

- I have only ever used VCS, but i was also recommended to googles IDE and im going to try that in the future.

## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?

- I did not run into any trouble.

## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?

-

I have used github for other courses.

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )

- I would use robot framework, only on the basis that for some reason there are alot of training possibilities near me. (I did google these options, but i cant really say without trying them.)

## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing

- Based on linkedin search
  Technical skills: programming languages, testing framework, ability to write high quality test cases and bugraports.

## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?

- I have some programming expirience, so first i would improve that further. Then i would learn more about automation proces (example being robot framework) last but not least would improve my understanding of the process(testcases, reports, etc.).

## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas?

- As i said i have done some programming before. There i have tested my own programs and improved them. That was far away from what this course has thought me. The biggest supprise was the fact that you have to do everything so speficily (understandably).

This course was great for me personally. Only thing i would have liked to seen diffrent, would've been that you would have 2 diffrent version to test. For instance in the middle of the course you would do version X.XX.1 test and at the end X.XX.2. Since this hands on part was what thought me the most.
